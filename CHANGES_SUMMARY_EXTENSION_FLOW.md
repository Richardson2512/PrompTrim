# Chrome Extension Flow - Recent Updates

## Summary
Updated the Chrome Extension "Get API Key" flow to provide a seamless experience for both new and existing users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Extension Popup (`popup.js`)
**Before:**
- Opened login page
- Required manual navigation to API keys page

**After:**
- Opens signup page (`http://localhost:5173/signup`)
- Platform automatically handles authentication state
- New users see signup form
- Existing users are redirected based on auth state

### 2. Platform App Routing (`App.tsx`)
**New Logic:**
- When user authenticates (via signup or login)
- If there's an `intendedRoute`, navigate to that route
- If there's no `intendedRoute` (coming from extension), redirect to API Keys page
- This ensures extension users always land on the API Keys page after authentication

**Code:**
```typescript
if (user && (currentRoute === 'login' || currentRoute === 'signup')) {
  // Check if user came from signup flow (intended route not set)
  // If coming from login/signup without intended route, go to API keys (extension flow)
  if (!intendedRoute) {
    console.log('ðŸ”„ User authenticated from login/signup, redirecting to API keys (extension flow)');
    navigateTo('api-keys');
  } else {
    console.log('ðŸ”„ User authenticated, redirecting to intended route or dashboard');
    navigateTo(intendedRoute || 'dashboard');
  }
}
```

## User Experience

### Scenario 1: New User (Never Used Platform Before)
1. Clicks "Get API Key" in extension
2. Opens signup page
3. Fills out signup form (email, password, name)
4. After successful signup â†’ Auto-redirected to API Keys page
5. Creates API key â†’ Copies it
6. Pastes in extension â†’ Saves
7. Extension becomes active

### Scenario 2: Existing User (Already Has Account)
1. Clicks "Get API Key" in extension
2. Opens signup page
3. Platform detects user is not authenticated
4. Can either:
   - Click "Login" link to sign in
   - If already authenticated in browser â†’ Auto-redirected to API Keys page
5. Creates API key â†’ Copies it
6. Pastes in extension â†’ Saves
7. Extension becomes active

### Scenario 3: Already Logged In
1. Clicks "Get API Key" in extension
2. Opens signup page
3. Platform detects user is already authenticated
4. Auto-redirected to API Keys page immediately
5. User creates new key or uses existing one

## Benefits

1. **Seamless Flow**: Users always land on API Keys page after authentication
2. **No Manual Navigation**: No need to click through dashboard to find API Keys
3. **Works for All Users**: New, existing, and already-authenticated users
4. **Intuitive**: Extension flow is self-contained and user-friendly

## Technical Notes

### Extension Behavior
- Always opens signup page (platform handles redirects)
- No need to detect if user already has account
- Platform's routing logic handles all scenarios

### Platform Routing
- `intendedRoute` mechanism for internal navigation (e.g., login â†’ dashboard â†’ dashboard)
- No `intendedRoute` means coming from extension â†’ go to API Keys
- Clear separation between internal and external (extension) flows
